VERSION: Prestashop 1.3.2 final

PREPARATION
===========

To install PrestaShop, you need a remote web server or on your computer (MAMP), with access to a database like MySQL.
You'll need access to phpMyAdmin to create a database and to indicate the information in the database in the installer.

If you do not host and unable to create your store, we offer a turnkey store, which lets you create your online store in less than 10 minutes without any technical knowledge.

Simply go to your PrestaShop web directory and use installer :-)

If you have any PHP error, perhaps you don't have PHP5 or you need to activate it on your web host.
Please go to our forum to find pre-installation settings (PHP 5, htaccess) for certain hosting services (1&1, Free, Lycos, OVH, Infomaniak, Amen, GoDaddy, etc).
